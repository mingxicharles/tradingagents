# ✅ Issues Fixed!

## Problems Identified

1. **NumPy compatibility**: Virtual environment had NumPy 2.x which is incompatible with torch
2. **API key not passed**: The `build_client()` function wasn't explicitly passing the API key to the client

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed NumPy Issue
```bash
# Updated virtual environment to use NumPy 1.x
pip install --upgrade "numpy<2"
```

### 2. Fixed API Key Passing
- Modified `tradingagents/llm.py` to explicitly pass the API key
- Added debug output to show when API key is present
- Updated requirements.txt to pin NumPy < 2

## How to Run Now

### Quick Test
```bash
# Set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key"

# Run the test
python3 test_runner.py
```

### Run the Pipeline
```bash
# Method 1: Use wrapper script
./run_with_key.sh AAPL --horizon 1w

# Method 2: Set key manually
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key"
python3 run.py AAPL --horizon 1w
```

## What's Working Now

✅ All imports successful  
✅ API key detected and passed correctly  
✅ API calls successful  
✅ Full pipeline working  
✅ Signal generation working  

## Virtual Environment

If you're using the `.trading` virtual environment, make sure it's activated:

```bash
source .trading/bin/activate
```

Or you can run without it (using system Python):

```bash
deactivate  # if currently in venv
python3 run.py AAPL
```

## Important Notes

1. **Your API key is exposed** - Please revoke it at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Each new terminal needs the key exported again (or use the wrapper script)
3. The virtual environment is now fixed with NumPy 1.x

## Next Steps

Try running the full pipeline:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key"
python3 run.py TSLA --horizon 1w --context "EV market analysis"
```

Check the generated signal:
```bash
ls -ltr signals/ | tail -1
cat signals/<latest_file>.json
```
