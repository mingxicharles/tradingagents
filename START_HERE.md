# üöÄ START HERE - Quick Start Guide

## The Simplest Way to Run (Choose One)

### Method 1: Use the wrapper script ‚≠ê (RECOMMENDED)

Just run:
```bash
./run_with_key.sh AAPL --horizon 1w
```

That's it! No need to set environment variables.

---

### Method 2: Set API key once, then run normally

**In your terminal, run these commands:**

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the project
cd /Users/charleswang/Downloads/USC/Courses/CS566/tradingagents

# 2. Set your API key (copy-paste this, then add your key)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"

# 3. Verify it's set
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# 4. Run the pipeline
python3 run.py AAPL --horizon 1w
```

---

### Method 3: Inline API key (one-time use)

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here" python3 run.py AAPL
```

---

## Quick Test

To verify everything works:

```bash
# Run the test suite
python3 test_runner.py

# Or just check if API works
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key" python3 -c "import asyncio; from tradingagents.llm import build_client; print(asyncio.run(build_client().complete([{'role':'user','content':'hi'}])))"
```

## üìù Important Notes

1. **Your API key is exposed** - Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys and delete the exposed key
2. The API key in the scripts is just an example - replace with your actual key
3. Each new terminal window needs the key set again (unless you add it to your shell profile)

---

1. Run: `./debug.sh` to see what's wrong
2. Check: `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed solutions
