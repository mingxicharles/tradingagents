""I think the super cycle term gets thrown around,"" says Bajarin. ""I mean, I'm just still of the strong conviction that hardware changes, design changes drive those super cycles, not software. I do still think this is going to be a stronger-than-normal upgrade cycle only because we've known that this is an aging base."" Bajarin went out to talk about the partnership between Apple and Sam Altman's OpenAI, the company that develops ChatGPT. ""I think OpenAI, they're not Google.
